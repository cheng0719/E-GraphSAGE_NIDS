# E-GraphSAGE NIDS Implementation

## Overview
This is a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) based on a Graph Neural Network (GNN), using E-GraphSAGE, implemented with PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric.


## Reference Paper Information
- **Title** : `E-GraphSAGE: A Graph Neural Network based Intrusion Detection System for IoT`
- **Link to Paper** : [E-GraphSAGE Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16329)
- **Official Implementation** : [Github Repository](https://github.com/waimorris/E-GraphSAGE/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file)

## Usage
Refer to the `E-GraphSAGE-PyG_version.ipynb` notebook for instructions on running the implementation.

## Future Work
- Develop a framework to automatically ingest datasets.
- Optimize the batching algorithm and identify an efficient method to extract subgraphs from the original graph to improve model performance.
